        Moving forward with my company I plan to find focus in a specific technology or two. Devoting my full attention
        to one roll I hope to build a solid reputation as a developer. With my portfolio started creating a wider
        network will come next and is a key component to starting a company for new developers. I’ll take that
        reputation I built to help other new developers and companies connect to build a network and
        company devoted to tech. It’s my ultimate goal and dream to help other developers while still continuing to have
        fun solving the problems and coding.

        Tech and development is like a playground to me, there’s endless possibility to grow your own skill. It’s always
        work keeping up and constantly learning but that’s also part of the fun and you always have the opportunity to
        be the one that makes the next big advancement I will be a successful web developer and create a business to
        help bring work to other freelancers.
