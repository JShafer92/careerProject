            Last year I learned to code at the University of Arizona’s coding bootcamp and received a certificate for
            completing the course. While I learned a lot about coding from the course I continued to learn more day by
            day coding small projects for fun and eventually picked up some courses on Udemy as well. As a developer you
            can never know to much and I constantly try to expand my knowledge and skills. I’ve expanded my
            understanding of javascript and learned other languages such as Python and Ruby.

            technology is essential. Great sources like Medium and following industry leaders on LinkdIn help insure
            you’re always up to date on the latest development news. Keeping up on new trends and the latest tech is
            necessary to developers that want to keep providing the best code possible for their customers.
