            My dream job is to work for myself on my own time. I love problem solving and helping people, being the go
            to for my friends and family is the start of my network. I also don't like working nine to five and web
            development gives me the freedom to work on my own schedule. I can even work and travel sitting on the beach
            with my laptop isn't a total pipe dream. Inspired by my friend and mentor I’ve seen endless possibility for personal and
            professional growth with developing. I’d eventually love to develop my brand
            into a small group of like minded developers and help them succeed as freelancers.
