            My dream job is to work for myself on my own time. I love problem solving and helping people, being the go
            to for my friends and family is the start of my network. Inspired by my friend and mentor I’ve seen endless
            possibility for personal and professional growth with developing. I’d eventually love to develop my brand
            into a small group of like minded developers and help them succeed as freelancers.
